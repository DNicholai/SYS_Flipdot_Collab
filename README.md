- [x] Document individual Module Components circuitry (as documented [here](Assets/Schematic_Module-pastille_2025-06-01_VVA.pdf), thanks to VVA!)
- [x] Document  individual Module 3D characteristics (as documented [here](Assets/Module_2D_Drawing), thanks to DPE)
- [ ] Select, test, and prove Power-Supply
- [ ] Select, test, and prove Power control chipset / componentry
- [ ] Select, test and prove Microcontroller (leaning towards ESP32 Dev based solution, but open to suggestions)
- [ ] Develop control library for microcontroller 
- [ ] Prove daisy-chaining of modules and the principals
- [ ] Complete Prototype with Surface Mount Components on Protoboard
- [ ] Transform Surface Mount solution Custom Circuit Board
